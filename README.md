### Charles Lechasseur (he/him)

Hello! üëã I'm a Software Developer and Architect from Qu√©bec, Canada. ~~Fun~~ facts about me:

- I've been programming since I was a kid, and professionally for over 20 years
- I've worked in many different programming languages, like Delphi Pascal, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.
- I currently work at [Petal](https://github.com/petalmd) as a Principal Developer
- I am autistic, sometimes wear a huge fiery red beard and understand the difference between correlation and causation
- I am a fan of [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org), a free site to learn new programming languages; I sometimes act as a mentor ([profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/clechasseur))
- I love [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) and I try to [complete the challenges every year](https://github.com/clechasseur?tab=repositories&q=adventofcode&type=&language=&sort=)
- I live in the woods with my husband, two Golden Retrievers, one cat and a flock of chickens (named after programming languages ü§ì)
